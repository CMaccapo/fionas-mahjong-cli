# Rosie's Fuzhou Mahjong Rules

## General

### Players and Turns
- 2-4 players arranged on any sides of the wall (square).
- Direction: Turns (regular gameplay and dealer) always go to the right (counter-clockwise).

#### Dealer

Dealers start the game.
If the current dealer wins, they deal again. If not, the player to the right deals next.

### Winning

Mahjong is played in hands. Players get points only if they win a hand. Games go until a set point value is reached or until the players decide to stop.

### Tiles (144)

#### Playable

These are the main tiles used for making sets. There are 3 suits:

1.  (4x9) Circles (1-9)
2. (4x9) Sticks (1-9)
3. (4x9) Characters (1-9)

#### Points

Any point tile = 1 point after winning.

- (4x4) Wind Tiles (N, S, E, W)
- (4x3) Dragon Tiles (Green, Red, Black)
- (1x4) Flowers (Plum Blossom, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo)
- (1x4) Seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)

### Player's Hand Tiles
Players should have: 

- 16 playable tiles if it is not their turn 
- 17 playable tiles if it is their turn

### Sets

The hand is arranged to make 5 sets of 3 and 1 pair (17 total tiles).

1. Pong - 3 of the same tile
2. Kong - 4 of the same tile
3. Series - 3 sequential numbers of the same suit.
4. Pair - 2 of the same tile

### The Wall
- 4 sides (of 2x18) with break
- Head: left of the break
- Tail: right of the break

### Getting Tiles

Tiles can be gotten from

1. The head of the wall - normal draw
2. The tail of the wall - points and kong draw
3. The boneyard - previous player's hand

## Gameplay

### Setup

1. Wash (mix) the tiles facedown
2. Arrange the wall into tiles 2 high 18 long on each side (4 sides)

### Assign Dealer

- Each player rolls 2 dice until someone gets the highest number. On a tie for highest, the ties re-roll.

### Breaking the Wall

- The dealer rolls two dice to get a Break Number. Starting with themselves, they count to the right that number for each side of the wall. The side they stop on is the Break Side.
- On the Break Side, count the Break Number starting from the right. Break the wall here. There should be Break Number of tiles to the right. 

### Initial Hands

1. Starting with the dealer, each player draws 4 tiles from the Head of the wall until each player has 16.
2. The dealer draws one extra to make 17.

### Exchange Points

1. Players set aside any point tiles.
2. On their turn, players get as many tiles from the Tail of the wall as points they drew last round.
- At the end of this phase, the dealer should have 17 playable tiles, and the others should have 16.

### Golden Tile

The dealer draws from the Tail until they get a playable tile. Place it face-up on the tail. 
This is the Golden Tile. Any tiles matching this are Wild Tiles and can be substituted for any other tiles in the hand.

### Main Game

On a player's turn they:
1. Draw a tile (from the wall or boneyard)
2. Call mahjong or discard a tile to the boneyard

#### Boneyard Tiles

- Boneyard tiles can only be gotten if they were most recently dropped. Otherwise, they are dead tiles and are out of the game.
- The next player can grab a boneyard tile only if they can make a set with it. Whenever a tile is gotten from the boneyard, the set is left face-up as proof.

#### Special Draw

Call Pong/Kong/Mahjong

-  If a player is one away from Pong, Kong, or Mahjong, they can call it at any time the last tile they need is dropped to force their turn and draw that tile.

### Mahjong: End Hand

When a player has 5 sets of 3 and 1 pair, they can call mahjong to win the hand. 

#### Mahjong Special Cases

If a player is 1 tile from mahjong during their first turn, they can grab the Golden Tile from the wall and win. 
If a player has 3 wild tiles, they win.

### Points Calculation

A player gets a point for each point tile, a point for each wild tile, +1pt for winning.
If they dealt last hand and won, their bonus win point increases by one for each win in streak.
If they won by drawing from the wall, their points are doubled.

#### Bonus Points

+20 won with no point tiles
+10 won with 1 point tile
+50 won with 3 wild tiles
+50 won from the wall wild tile
+100 won with 2 wild tiles as pair
